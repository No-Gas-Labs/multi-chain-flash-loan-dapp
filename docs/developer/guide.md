# Developer Guide for Multi-Chain Flash Loan DApp

This guide provides detailed information about the architecture, components, and development workflow for the Multi-Chain Flash Loan DApp.

## Architecture Overview

The Multi-Chain Flash Loan DApp is built with a modular architecture that enables cross-chain arbitrage between TON, EOS, and SUI blockchains. The system consists of the following main components:

### Frontend (React Native/Expo)

The frontend is a mobile-first application built with React Native and Expo, providing a user-friendly interface for:

- Wallet connection for TON, EOS, and SUI
- Flash loan initiation and management
- Arbitrage opportunity visualization
- Transaction history and analytics
- Account management

### Backend (Node.js)

The backend serves as the orchestration layer, responsible for:

- Cross-chain communication
- Arbitrage opportunity detection
- Flash loan coordination
- AI-powered optimization
- Security monitoring
- API services for the frontend

### Smart Contracts

The project includes smart contracts for three blockchain platforms:

1. **TON Contracts (FunC)**
   - Flash loan provider
   - Arbitrage executor
   - Security modules

2. **EOS Contracts (C++)**
   - Flash loan provider
   - Cross-chain bridge
   - Arbitrage executor

3. **SUI Contracts (Move)**
   - Flash loan provider
   - Liquidity pool
   - Arbitrage executor

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization

The project follows a modular structure:

```

└── scripts/               # Utility scripts
```

### Delta Tracking System

The project uses a delta tracking system (Δ1–Δ18) to track iterative improvements across all components. Each file contains delta headers indicating its current development stage.

Example delta header:
```javascript
/**
 * @file orchestration.ts
 * @description Multi-chain flash loan orchestrator - Δ13 Enhanced Routing
 * @version 1.0.0-Δ13
 */
```

### Development Process

1. **Setup Environment**
   - Follow the [Installation Guide](../../INSTALLATION.md) to set up your development environment

2. **Understand the Architecture**
   - Review the [Architecture Document](./architecture.md) for detailed system design

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Make changes to the relevant components
   - Follow the delta tracking system for versioning
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Submit pull requests with clear descriptions

4. **Testing**
   - Run unit tests for individual components
   - Run integration tests for cross-component functionality
   - Run regression tests to ensure existing functionality is not broken

## Smart Contract Development

### TON Contract Development

TON contracts are written in FunC and deployed using the TON CLI:

1. Write your contract in `contracts/ton/`
2. Compile using the TON compiler
3. Test using the test framework
4. Deploy using the deployment script

Example TON contract structure:
```func
;; @title Flash Loan Provider
;; @version Δ12
;; @description Provides flash loans on TON blockchain

() recv_internal(int msg_value, cell in_msg_cell, slice in_msg) impure {
    ;; Contract logic here
}

;; Flash loan function
() provide_loan(slice borrower, int amount) impure {
    ;; Loan logic here
}
```

### EOS Contract Development

EOS contracts are written in C++ and deployed using the EOS CLI:

1. Write your contract in `contracts/eos/`
2. Compile using the EOS CDT
3. Test using the test framework
4. Deploy using the deployment script

### SUI Contract Development

SUI contracts are written in Move and deployed using the SUI CLI:

1. Write your contract in `contracts/sui/sources/`
2. Compile using the SUI compiler
3. Test using the test framework
4. Deploy using the deployment script

## API Reference

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [API Reference](../api/api-reference.md).

## Optimization Service

The optimization service uses AI algorithms to identify the most profitable arbitrage opportunities across the three blockchains. Key components include:

1. **Price Monitoring**
   - Real-time price feeds from multiple sources
   - Historical price analysis
   - Volatility tracking

2. **Opportunity Detection**
   - Cross-chain price discrepancy detection
   - Fee calculation and optimization
   - Risk assessment

3. **Execution Strategy**
   - Path optimization
   - Timing optimization
   - Gas fee optimization

## Security Considerations

When developing for this project, keep the following security considerations in mind:

1. **Smart Contract Security**
   - Follow best practices for each blockchain platform
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use safe math libraries to prevent overflows
   - Implement circuit breakers for emergency situations

2. **Backend Security**
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use secure communication channels
   - Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

3. **Frontend Security**
   - Never store private keys in the frontend
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Use secure storage for sensitive information
   - Implement proper error handling
